				Crisp, delicate and oh-so-drinkable, the German-style Kolsch is a beer hybrid, meaning that its
				production and subsequent beer drinking experience saddles qualities of both lager beers and ale beers.
				These light and refreshing ale-lager hybrids are perfect for warm summer days and have become a favored
				style by American craft brewers and beer lovers alike. In addition to their thirst quenching ability,
				they also are a fun beer to enjoy with food, including traditional German sausages and kraut.
